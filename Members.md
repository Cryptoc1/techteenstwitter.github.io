# Docs for Adding to `members.js`

"[Lloyd](https://youtu.be/pgIzBmbI-zQ), take off your hat in respect. RESPECT FOR THE DEAD!"

If you're here, it probably means your apart of this stupid organization/group/*cult*, and for that, I respect you. It could also mean that you're
trying to add your information to the TTT website. If either are the case, you're probably in the right place.

## A Few Basic Rules
* `members.js` is basically treated like a json file, without having to make any requests
* Please don't modify &lt;*insert member you have a grudge against*>'s info
* Stay within the present aesthetics (don't implement your own styles)


### Portraits
The portrait property is the image that will appear on your card on the website. 
Things to note about the property are this:

* It can be set to a relative path
* It can be set to a url

If you're not going to use a url, then your portrait image should be put in `static/portraits/` upon submission of your pull request.

### Projects
The projects property is an array of objects, of which contain a `title` and `url` for a specific project.

### Skills and Interests
Just arrays of strings, pretty simple.
